# 🧪 Learning Project: World Generation with Three.js + TypeScript

This project was created for **educational purposes** to explore:

-   Working with **Three.js** (rendering 3D/2D scenes in the browser),
-   Using **TypeScript** in a React environment,
-   Procedural generation of dungeons, tiles, and world structures,
-   Separating generation logic from rendering logic.

## 🚧 What’s Included

-   A simple dungeon/tilemap generator,
-   Rendering using `Three.js`,
-   Modular architecture (generation, data, rendering separated).

## 💡 Goal

The main goal of this project is to better understand:

-   How to visualize generated data in a 3D scene,
-   How to build procedural generation tools,
-   How to structure code in a clean and scalable way.

## 📦 Tech Stack

-   Vite + React
-   TypeScript
-   Three.js

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is **not production-ready**. It’s meant for learning, testing, and experimenting.
